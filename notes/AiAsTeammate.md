0:00 - I've always been jealous of Winston Churchill.

0:02 - There's a quote, by the way.

0:04 - The history of innovation is the bed, the bus and the bathtub.

0:08 - It's always these moments when we're not really thinking about work

0:11 - or we're kind of doing something else that good ideas come to us.

0:15 - Winston Churchill,

0:16 - He's sitting in the bathtub, and he's dictating a national address

0:20 - to his assistant who's in the other room.

0:22 - She's saying, "distinguished ladies and gentlemen"

0:25 - "Don't call them distinguished"

0:27 - "They're not"

0:28 - This is the Gary Oldman version. "They're not distinguished."

0:31 - You know, "Dear ladies and gentlemen, we have gathered together."

0:35 - "Get to the point!"

0:37 - and I'm watching this going

0:39 - I would give anything to have an assistant who understood my context and my voice and

0:45 - my intent well enough that I could sit in the bath and they could write my speech.

0:50 - Now, the poorest villager in Palo Alto

0:54 - can have what only Winston Churchill

0:57 - used to have,

0:58 - which is an assistant that has my context and my voice and my intent available to me

1:04 - so that when I'm in the bathtub, I can be dictating my address.

1:08 - That is absolutely technically possible today.

1:18 - Ep.1 How to Become a Better Collaborator with AI

1:20 - I'm Jeremy Utley, I'm an adjunct professor of creativity

1:24 - and AI at Stanford University.

## Who is Jeremy Utley?

1:26 - I've been teaching at Stanford for the last 15 years

1:29 - at the intersection of creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship, and now

1:33 - increasingly, artificial intelligence.

1:35 - The topic that I'm most focused on right now is helping non-technical professionals

1:41 - learn to be good collaborators to or with generative AI.

1:46 - And then two years ago,

1:47 - myself and my partner at the time, Perry Klebahn, wrote a book called

1:51 - Idea Flow, which was the canonical book on idea generation and prototyping.

1:56 - So super proud of that.

1:58 - It was the culmination of a dozen years of leading executive programs

2:02 - and the leadership program and the entrepreneurship program at Stanford.

2:06 - And one month after our book came out, ChatGPT came out.

2:11 - To me, the fact that I wrote the canonical book on Idea generation just prior to AI

2:18 - is like writing the best book on retail just before the internet.

2:23 - AI is a tool to dramatically augment and amplify our creativity.

2:28 - And the truth is, I didn't know a lot about it when the book came out.

2:31 - So one month after my book came out, instead of going on a world book tour,

2:36 - I strapped myself back into the front row as a student and said,

2:41 - I need to be learning about this transformative new technology.

2:44 - So I started taking classes. I started conducting research.

2:47 - I started working with and studying teams inside of organizations, using the tool

2:52 - to understand the simple question,

2:55 - how does generative AI impact the individual and the team and the

3:00 - organization's ability to solve problems?

3:04 - Chapter1. Don't Ask AI, Let It Ask You

## Do not Ask AI, Let It Ask You

3:06 - You can give an AI a prompt, for example.

3:09 - How should I answer this question?

3:12 - Or you could give an AI the question

3:15 - I want to ask how I should answer this question.

3:18 - What's the best way of framing that question to an AI?

3:22 - So you see what I did there?

3:24 - I asked AI for how to ask I my question,

3:28 - but you can use AI to use AI, which is you couldn't use Excel to use Excel.

3:33 - PowerPoint can't teach you how to use PowerPoint.

3:35 - Email can't teach you how to use email.

3:37 - AI strangely can teach you how to use itself if you think to ask.

3:41 - Go to your language model of choice and just say the following.

3:45 - Hey, you're an AI expert.

3:48 - I would love your help and a consultation with you to help me figure out

3:53 - where I can best leverage AI in my life.

3:56 - As an AI expert, would you please ask me questions one question at a time,

## The 10X Creativity Hack

4:01 - until you have enough context about my workflows and responsibilities and KPIs

4:05 - and and objectives that you could

4:07 - make two obvious recommendations and two non-obvious recommendations

4:12 - for how AI could leverage AI in my work.

4:15 - you will have one of the most enlightening and illuminating conversations you've ever had,

4:20 - and it's all because of AI's ability to evaluate its own work.

4:24 - What I've seen is non-technical employees are able to do incredible things.

4:28 - Here's one example.

4:29 - The National Park Service called me and asked me if I would

4:33 - conduct a training program for a bunch of backcountry rangers,

4:37 - so they gathered a group of about 60 backcountry rangers and facilities managers

4:42 - into a training session,

4:43 - and I spent a couple of hours over zoom teaching folks the basics of collaborating with AI.

4:49 - One of the people in that session was a gentleman named Adam Rymer,

4:53 - who works at Glen Canyon National Park.

4:55 - And one of the things I say is you should focus on parts of your work that you dread.

5:00 - Parts of your work that you don't enjoy.

5:03 - "Ah, I have to do this again."

5:05 - And Adam said, if I have to replace the carpet tiles in the lodge.

5:09 - I have to fill out all this paperwork.

5:10 - And so to replace a carpet tile will sometimes take 2 or 3 days of paperwork.

5:15 - Then he thought, could AI help me write that paperwork?

5:18 - And in 45 minutes, he built a tool with natural language

5:23 - that saves him two days of work.

5:26 - Every day he makes a statement of work and then listen to this.

5:30 - Someone got access to that tool and shared it across the other parks.

5:35 - There's about 430 parks in the service.

5:38 - The National Park Service is estimating that the tool that Adam built in 45 minutes

5:42 - is going to save the service 7000 days of human labor this year.

5:48 - That's the kind of impact that normal professionals can have, even without

5:55 - any technical ability, if only they're given very basic foundational training.

6:02 - Chapter2. Do not Use AI, Treat It as a Teammate

## I Don't USE AI

6:04 - People are wanting to learn AI and how it can be transformative for their business,

6:08 - but they don't have the basic language.

6:11 - And so while lots of organizations are asking me how can we work with AI

6:15 - to transform our business?

6:16 - Where I have to start with them is how do you work with AI?

6:20 - The research I'm familiar with suggests that while on the one hand,

6:23 - AI makes people 25% faster and 12% more work and 40% better quality,

6:29 - it's also true that less than 10% of working professionals

6:33 - are deriving meaningful productivity gains from collaboration with AI.

6:37 - To me, there's this enormous gap. I call it the realization gap.

6:42 - We conducted studies both in Europe and in the United States.

6:45 - And what we found is, surprisingly, AI didn't help most people be more creative.

## Why Do Some People Produce More Creative Results Using the Same AI Tools?

6:51 - In fact, in many cases, the people that we studied, AI made them less creative.

6:56 - And as we started digging into the research,

6:58 - we were surprised and looked at the data.

7:00 - We were confused because you think AI should make people

7:04 - more creative, not less.

7:05 - And we studied the underperformers and then we studied the Outperformers.

7:10 - And what we found is the Outperformers had a fundamentally different orientation

7:15 - towards AI than the underperformers did, whereas the underperformers

7:21 - treated AI like a tool.

7:23 - The outperformers treated AI like a teammate,

7:28 - and shifting your orientation from tool to teammate changes everything

7:33 - about the kinds of outcomes that you can achieve

7:36 - working with generative AI. A simple example is what do you do

7:40 - when it gives you mediocre results?

7:43 - If it's a tool, you get a mediocre result and then maybe you improve it.

7:48 - Or maybe you say, it's no good at doing that.

7:51 - If it's a teammate who's giving you a mediocre result,

7:54 - think about the last teammate who gave you work product that wasn't sufficient.

7:58 - You gave them feedback.

7:59 - You gave them coaching, you gave them mentorship, you helped them improve it.

8:04 - And so what we found is that people who treat AI like a teammate, coach it

8:08 - and give it feedback and importantly, get it to ask them questions.

8:13 - The fundamental orientation a lot of people take towards AI

8:16 - is I'm the question asker.

8:18 - AI is the answer giver.

8:20 - But if you think about AI like a teammate, you say, hey, what are ten questions

## Treat AI As a Teammate

8:25 - I should ask about this?

8:26 - Or what do you need to know from me in order to get the best response?

8:31 - So things, for example, like you have a difficult conversation

8:34 - coming up with a coworker.

8:36 - Did you know you could leverage a large language model

8:38 - to roleplay that conversation?

8:41 - You can get an AI to interview you about your conversation partner,

8:45 - and then construct a psychological profile of your conversation partner,

8:49 - and then play the role of your conversation partner in a roleplay,

8:53 - and then give you feedback from the perspective of your conversation partner

8:57 - on how you approach the conversation.

8:59 - That's something you can do today, and there are many things like that.

9:03 - I call them drills,

9:04 - but there are many things like that where if someone will just shift

9:08 - their consideration set of what

9:11 - are the things I can do with AI. They end up discovering applications

9:16 - that I've never even dreamed of.

9:17 - I've been doing this stuff for two years, and my students are regularly

9:21 - coming to me with use cases I've never imagined that landed them in a destination

9:26 - I could have never predicted,

9:27 - and they could never have predicted.

## Inspiration is a Discipline

9:30 - For me, I never thought about myself as a creative individual.

9:33 - Now, I fully and fundamentally believe every single human being

9:38 - has innate creative capacity.

9:40 - Every single one of us.

9:41 - What the D.school has helped me do is unlock others.

9:45 - Everyone has this latent creative capacity.

9:48 - Once I was teaching a class with a hip hop artist named Lecrae.

9:52 - He's a multi-time Grammy Award winning artist, and he and I are teaching a class

9:56 - to graduate students at Stanford, and we're giving them the assignment.

9:59 - You've got to go get inspiration in the world.

10:01 - And what I can see is it's like looking at myself in the mirror ten years ago,

10:05 - because all of the business school students

10:06 - in the class are going, "inspiration?"

10:10 - And I just felt Lecrae is clearly the The creative legend in the room.

10:15 - I said, Lecrae, what do you think about inspiration?

10:18 - And of course, as only a hip hop artist could do, he dropped a bar.

10:21 - He said, inspiration is a discipline.

10:24 - And I realized in that moment, for these students,

10:27 - it's not even on their radar as a tool, let alone a routine part of their life.

10:33 - But the most wildly creative individuals I know are disciplined about cultivating

10:39 - the inputs to their thinking, because they know it affects

10:41 - the outputs of their thinking.

10:43 - And so, even in regards to AI, I push people.

10:47 - What is the inspiration you're bringing to the model?

10:49 - Everybody has the same access to the same ChatGPT.

10:53 - How do I get a different output than you do?

10:55 - It's because of what I bring to the model. And what do I bring to the model?

10:59 - Certainly I bring technique, but I also bring my experience.

11:03 - I bring my perspective.

11:04 - I bring all the inspiration I've gleaned from the world.

11:07 - That's what gets a user a differential output from a model.

11:11 - Chapter3. How to Go Beyond ‘Good Enough’ Ideas

11:14 - A seventh grader in Ohio who I don't even know what her name is,

## The Definition of Creativity in the Age of AI

11:18 - but her teacher asked, what is creativity?

11:20 - And she put a post-it note up on the board that says,

11:22 - Creativity is doing more

11:24 - than the first thing you think of.

11:27 - And that's my favorite definition, because it speaks to a profound

11:31 - cognitive bias that we hold.

11:33 - It's been called functional fixedness. It's been called the Einstellung effect.

11:37 - But the basic premise is humans tend to fixate on an early solution

11:44 - and be satisfied.

11:45 - Herbert Simon called it satisficing, but it's the idea that if we get

11:49 - to good enough, it's enough.

11:51 - And that's why I love that seventh graders definition.

11:53 - Creativity is doing more than the first thing you think of.

11:56 - It's pushing past. Good enough.

11:59 - Is the definition of creativity changing in the age of AI?

12:03 - I don't think so.

12:04 - The reality is, with AI, it's now easier than ever to get good enough.

12:10 - If your goal is world class, if your goal is exceptional, then what you

12:14 - want to be prompting for is actually volume and variation, and that takes time.

12:20 - It takes time to not only read through it, but to sort it and to process it.

12:25 - But fundamentally, the definition of creativity doesn't change in the age of AI.

12:30 - It's just that the human's ability or inability to arrive at a creative state

12:35 - is affected not only by the technology,

12:38 - but also by their stated or unstated objectives in collaborating with it.

12:45 - Creators don't need to be afraid of AI. Creators need to dive in.

12:49 - They need to lean in.

12:50 - Creators are about to be unleashed in a way they've never been unleashed before.

12:55 - The only correct answer to the question how do you use AI?

12:59 - Is I don't. I don't use AI. I work with it.

13:04 - When you start working with AI, it will change everything.
