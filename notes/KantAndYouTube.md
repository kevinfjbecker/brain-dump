# Kant and YouTube

The digital should be used intentionally. Substitute "nature" below with social media.

> Reason must approach nature with the view, indeed, of receiving information from it, not, however, in the character of a pupil, who listens to all that his master chooses to tell him, but in that of a judge, who compels the witnesses to reply to those questions which he himself thinks fit to propose.

Immanuel Kant (1855). “Critique of Pure Reason”, p.27

NB: I do think that we should approach nature as a pupil though
