# API Pipeline Training plan

## Prerequisite

* Postman

## Scenario

Can you make us a new pipeline? Itâ€™s gonna be pretty much the same as document import from DTS. (Actually exactly the same ðŸ˜œ) Here is a URL and the secret. Let me know when I can look at the data in the database.

## Walk-through

### Postman

1. Create an environment
1. Create a collection
1. Get a token
1. Get the documents

### Pims

1. Create a pipeline
1. Create an API task
1. Create an API endpoint config
1. (NB: we already have the secret)
1. Run it?

## Next time

Running it locallyâ€¦
