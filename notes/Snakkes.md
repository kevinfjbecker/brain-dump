# Snakkes

* Når sees vi igjen? (When do we see each other again?)
* Vi møtes klokka fire. (We’ll meet [each other] at 4 o’ clock.)
* In these cases, the job of the letter is not to passivize anything. Instead, it adds the notion of reciprocity (”each other”) to the verb.
* Vi snakkes! (Talk to you later!, literally: We’ll talk with each other!)

The mediopassive voice is a grammatical voice which subsumes the meanings of both the middle voice and the passive voice.

* Reflexive: "Jeg mindes min ungdom" ("I remember my youth"/"I'm reminded of my youth"). The form mindes is usually called passive, but the meaning is medial. The present active minder means "remind(s)". Historically, mindes is a contraction of the active forms and the reflexive pronoun: hun minder sig ("she reminds herself") → hun mindes ("she remembers"). "She" is both the agent and the patient, so the expression works in much the same way as reflexive middle forms of ancient indo-European languages like Greek and Sanskrit.
* Reciprocal: "Vi ses" is the everyday expression equivalent in Danish to the English "See you." The present active is "vi ser" (we see); the mediopassive (commonly called passive) form is historically derived thus: de ser sig ("they see themselves") → de ses ("they are seen" or "they see themselves/see each other"). The third person forms have since been generalized by analogy to the first and second person, and as the future progressive is often expressed with simple present in Danish, the meaning is, "We'll be seeing each other."
* Autocausative: "Han glædes over sin gave" ("He gets/is happy with his gift"), from "Han glæder sig over sin gave".
