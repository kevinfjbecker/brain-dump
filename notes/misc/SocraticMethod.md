# Socratic Method

## Key principles

* Facilitate, don't lecture: The role of the questioner is to guide the conversation, not to be the sole source of information.
* Maintain a supportive tone: The questioning should be done with curiosity, not as an aggressive challenge, to avoid making the person feel defensive.
* Focus on critical thinking: The primary goal is to improve the ability to think through a problem, not just to reach a specific, predetermined answer.
* Assume ignorance (ironically): The questioner may "pretend" to know less to compel the other person to explain their knowledge in detail.
* Listen actively: Pay close attention to the answers to inform the next question, ensuring the dialogue stays on track.
