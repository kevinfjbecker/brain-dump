# Mechanics for hyper casual games

## 1. Timing mechanics

Also known as “tap mechanics”, this is when users must tap their screens to complete an action at the right time.

## 2. Rising/falling mechanics

This mechanic shows an object that rises or falls through a digital environment.

## 3. Puzzle mechanics

This hyper casual game format is completed by applying logic and correctly placing objects around a device’s screen.

## 4. Stacking mechanics

As you’d expect, stacking mechanics require users to stack objects

## 5. Agility mechanics

Not to be confused with timing mechanics, games using agility mechanics are completed by users repeating motions with precision and speed.

## 6. Growing mechanics

Games that utilize growing mechanics require the user to become the largest object, often through absorption, to progress.

## 7. Turning mechanics

Turning mechanics, like those used in Skiddy Car, require users to turn left and right within a 3D environment.

## 8. Swerving mechanics

Slightly different to turning mechanics, users playing a swerving mechanic game must accurately maneuver an object on their mobile screen while avoiding certain elements.

## 9. Merging mechanics

Games that use a merging mechanic rely on a satisfying progression model.
