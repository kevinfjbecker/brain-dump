## Action Priority

* avoid discarding
* have enough bits to rez all unrezzed ICE assuming average cost.
* play ICE to cover each data fort with two pieces of ICE
* advance cards that can be advanced (in play order; 1 bit per turn)
* data fort construction { ICE, ICE, Asset / Agenda }
* gain bits

## Other Stuff

* add ice to broken data forts if the fort has been successfully run 2 times
* purge viruses there are more than 5 virus tokens in play
* cover archives if Sneakdoor Beta is in play

## Further

* don't Rez a known Cell Portal if it is the outer moist piece of ICE
