# Holding lightly

Are you familiar with Blades in the Dark?

Yeah, I'm familiar with Blades in the Dark! It’s a tabletop RPG by John Harper, known for its gritty, cinematic style and focus on criminal crews in a haunted industrial-fantasy city called Doskvol. The mechanics are pretty unique too—flashbacks, stress, and the whole “fiction-first” approach make it a very narrative-driven game.

Are you playing, running a game, or just diving into the lore and mechanics?

Could you elaborate on the idea of "hold on lightly" for a game master in blades in the dark?

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely. “Hold on lightly” is a really core philosophy for a GM (or “Game Master”) in Blades in the Dark. It basically means don’t grip too tightly onto your plans, your expectations, or control over the story. Instead, you're meant to trust the fiction, the mechanics, and—most importantly—the players.

Here’s how that plays out in practice:

🧭 1. Don’t Overplan — Build to Discover
In Blades, the world is reactive. You don’t need to plan out elaborate heists or tightly plotted arcs. Instead, you set up situations and see how the players interact with them.

Instead of saying, “This is exactly how the score will go,” you offer the starting situation and let the mechanics + players’ choices + complications shape the rest.

Flashbacks allow for players to "plan" retroactively. So you don’t need to (and shouldn’t) ask for hour-long planning sessions before a mission.

🎭 2. Let the Fiction Breathe
“Hold on lightly” means that the story doesn’t belong just to the GM. It’s a collaborative narrative. You’re there to present opportunities, react honestly, and ask questions. A few things this might look like:

Asking players: “What does that look like?” or “How do you know this contact?”

Letting consequences emerge naturally from fiction and mechanics—not from trying to “make” something happen.

⚖️ 3. Follow the Mechanics — They Do Heavy Lifting
Blades has elegant systems for pushing the fiction forward—position, effect, clocks, stress, consequences, resistance rolls, etc. “Holding on lightly” means you don’t need to fudge rolls or protect the players. The game gives everyone tools to deal with danger and consequences.

If a player pushes too hard and gets burned? That’s part of the story.

If they resist brilliantly and turn the tide? Awesome—celebrate it!

🌀 4. Embrace Chaos and Emergent Storytelling
One of the most magical things about Blades is that stories emerge you couldn’t have written ahead of time. Let that happen. The best sessions come from moments you didn’t plan.

A desperate roll gone wrong leads to a new enemy.

A rival makes a bold move because of a faction clock you were half-tracking.

A downtime action spirals into an entire arc.

This style is all about responding, not orchestrating.

If you find yourself stressed because the players are “going off the rails,” it probably means you’re gripping too tightly. But in Blades, there are no rails. Just a shared spotlight and a burning city full of ghosts and opportunity.

Are you GMing a game now, or just getting ready to run one?

You said:

Could you relate same concept "hold on lightly" to software development?

ChatGPT said:

Absolutely—“hold on lightly” has a powerful place in software development, too, especially in creative, agile, or product-focused environments. Here's how it translates:

🧠 What Does “Hold On Lightly” Mean for Software Development?
At its core, it’s the mindset of:

Plan, design, and build with intention—but be ready to adapt, respond, and evolve.

It’s about resisting the urge to grip too tightly onto initial ideas, roadmaps, or assumptions. Just like a Blades GM, you’re creating a structure where emergent complexity, user needs, and team dynamics can influence what happens next.

🧰 Where It Shows Up in Practice
1. Lightweight Planning over Heavy Upfront Design
Don’t spend weeks building detailed specs for a feature you might pivot from.

Start with lightweight user stories or goals. Get something working and then iterate based on feedback.

🗣 Like in Blades: You set the scene (the problem), not the entire plot (the solution).

2. Agile and Iterative Mindsets
Agile is basically “hold on lightly” made into process: short sprints, fast feedback loops, continuous delivery.

Build the smallest useful thing, get it in users’ hands, learn, and refine.

🧭 You’re discovering the path as you go, not trying to predict it all at the start.

3. Embracing Uncertainty and Change
Requirements change. Markets shift. What users say they want isn’t always what they need.

“Holding on tightly” means you resist change and stick to The Plan™. “Holding on lightly” means you’re ready to change direction when you learn something new.

💥 Like when a player in Blades uses a flashback to totally reframe what’s happening—you say, “Yes, and…”

4. Collaborative Creation
Just like a Blades GM collaborates with players to build the world, great dev teams co-create solutions.

Product managers, devs, designers, and users all shape the outcome. If one person tries to control everything, innovation dies.

👥 “Hold on lightly” invites more voices into the process.

5. Don’t Over-Engineer
You don’t need the perfect abstraction, the most general framework, or the infinite-scale solution—especially not on day one.

Build what you need now, in a way that allows change later.

⚙️ YAGNI (“You Aren’t Gonna Need It”) is basically “hold on lightly” in code form.

🎯 The Balance
“Hold on lightly” isn’t the same as being careless or aimless.

It’s about building with clarity and flexibility:

You still have vision, purpose, goals.

But you don’t treat those things as sacred.

You listen, adapt, and respond to what actually happens.

Just like in Blades in the Dark, the story you're writing with your software isn't fully known at the start—but that's what makes it good.

Would you say your dev work leans more structured or more flexible? Or are you trying to shift toward that “light touch”?
